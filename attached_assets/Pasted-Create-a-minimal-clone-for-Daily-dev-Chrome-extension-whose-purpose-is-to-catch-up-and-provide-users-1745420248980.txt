### Notes on Some Specific Feeds:
- **David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH)**: His personal blog RSS is often at dhh.dk/rss.xml or similar, but many essays are also on his Basecamp blog.
- **Medium**: RSS feeds are per publication or tag, e.g., for JavaScript tag: `https://medium.com/feed/tag/javascript`.
- **Computerworld**: No official RSS feed readily available; you may need to create one using RSS creation tools or browser extensions.
- **Substack newsletters**: Append `/feed` to the newsletter URL for RSS, e.g., `https://hipstertech.substack.com/feed`.

These feeds cover the broad spectrum of tech news, developer insights, and community content aggregated by Daily.dev, enabling you to follow the latest updates directly via RSS readers.

If you want, I can help generate a consolidated OPML file with these feeds for easy import into your RSS reader.
